This event was very useful for those who want to start with machine learning. We got to know about the steps
 i.e data gathering, data preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training and make predictions.
 and much more like python, visual studio or may be visualizations. We also learnt about 
Azure which makes it easy for machine learning codes..
Thanks for this useful session.
